# PINN on matlab

These results were obtained using the adsorption exercise's model.

- The Analytical solutions models focus on PINN like models which try to fit analytical solutions.
- The mixedPINN models try to modelize the adsorption reaction using the analytical solution for one of the concentration
- The PINN models try to modelize the adsorption reaction with a PINN

Each model is provided with a comparison graph between the validation and the prediction data with the error in the title, as well as a .mat file which posess the model, the validation inputs and data and the predicted data on these validation inputs.
