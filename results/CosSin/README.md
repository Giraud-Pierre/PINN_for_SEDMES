# PINN on matlab

These results were obtained using testUfunction model in the SimpleCosSin folder. These results were achieved using very simple models to prove the feasability of the method.


Fitnet was used as a control to fit this equation using a build-in model.

The results were satisfactory. The PINN like model could approach the fitnet result with some finetuning but it is not the purpose of this project.
