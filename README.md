# PINN_for_SEDMES
The idea in this project is to evaluate the feasability of using PINNs to modelize the reaction happening inside a Sorption Enhanced DiMethyl Ether Synthesis reactor (more information on this paper: van Kampen, Jasper & Boon, Jurriaan & Vente, Jaap & Annaland, M.. (2020). Sorption enhanced dimethyl ether synthesis for high efficiency carbon conversion: Modelling and cycle design. Journal of CO2 Utilization. 37. 10.1016/j.jcou.2019.12.021. [available here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339091142_Sorption_enhanced_dimethyl_ether_synthesis_for_high_efficiency_carbon_conversion_Modelling_and_cycle_design]).

The purpose would be to design a fast model to predict at every moment in time the state of the reaction (the concentration of product) inside any given place in the reactor and to find the optimal parameters for better yield.

Given the complexity of this reaction, the relative novelty of PINNs and the fact that I am only a master student, this project was conducted on simpler exercise on the other branches of this repository.
