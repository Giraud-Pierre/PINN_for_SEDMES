# PINN on matlab

On this branch, the work has been switch to matlab which offers easier debugging and plotting tools. Clone this repository using the usual command "git clone -b Matlab https://github.com/Giraud-Pierre/PINN_for_SEDMES.git" and you will be able to run anyfile on matlab 2023a. Some of the code also requires the "AI computing toolbox" and "Simulink".

The data folder contains data files (.mat) and solver functions used to train and test the matlab PINN.

The losses folder contains the loss functions used for the PINNs

The model folder contain the actual building, training and testing of the PINNs.
