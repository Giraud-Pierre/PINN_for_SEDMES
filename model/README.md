# PINN on matlab: Model

This folder contain the actual building, training and testing of the PINNs. Several exercises were attempted:
- Modelizing simple Cosinus - Sinus functions to check how the structure works
- Designing a "PINNBlanck" which attempts to fit any provided function y with regards to 2 parameter, x and t, using a PINN like structure.
- Modelizing the solution of Burger's equation
- Modelizing the adsorption in a fixed bed reactor exercise that was tried on python on the other branch (more information in the data folder)
