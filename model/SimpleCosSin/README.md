# PINN on matlab: Model

These models were used to solve analytically cosine and sine function with 2 different inputs. The purpose was to design a framework for PINN to work on other problems.

- TestCosSinWithFitnet uses a build-in fitnet algorithm as control
- TestUfunctions works a bit like PINN blank, being able to solve any function fiting the formalism, but it was designed to fit simple cosine and sine function.
